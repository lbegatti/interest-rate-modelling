# interest-rate-modelling
R/Python code for modelling interest rate products based on the "Interest Rate Models" course on Coursera taught by Damir FilipoviÄ‡. The topics vary a lot from basic application of formulae to pseudoinverse method to find the discount curve. You are welcome to reach out for access and if you need clarifications, I will do my best to help out.
